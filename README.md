# University Graph-Based Transport System

This project is a **Python implementation** of a smart inter-university transportation and booking system.  
It was developed as a course project for **Algorithm Design**.

The system models universities and routes as a **graph** and provides intelligent route planning, booking, and trip optimization using advanced algorithms.

## ðŸš€ Features

### Phase 1: University Graph Construction
- Models universities and connections as a **weighted graph**.
- Uses **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** algorithms (Prim) to minimize construction costs.
- Ensures each university is reachable within a limited radius using **BFS**.
- Supports **dynamic insertion** of new universities without reconstructing the entire graph.

### Phase 2: Intelligent Booking System
- Allows students to book inter-university trips.
- Suggests **optimal paths** based on **shortest time** or **minimum cost** using **Dijkstra**.
- Manages seat capacity and prevents overbooking.
- Maintains a **priority queue** for pending reservations if routes are full.
- Includes **visualization** (graphs and heatmaps) to show real-time usage.

### Phase 3: Multi-Trip Optimization
- Handles travel requests where a student needs to visit multiple universities in one day.
- Uses **Dynamic Programming (Bitmasking)** and Computes the best visiting order to minimize total cost.
